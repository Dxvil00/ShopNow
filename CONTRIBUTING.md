## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python (Django)
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example Code Style
```python
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.http import JsonResponse
from .models import Product, Category


@login_required
def product_detail(request, product_id: int) -> JsonResponse:
    """
    Display detailed information about a specific product.
    
    Args:
        request: HTTP request object
        product_id: ID of the product to display
        
    Returns:
        JsonResponse: Product details in JSON format
    """
    product = get_object_or_404(Product, id=product_id)
    
    context = {
        'product': product,
        'related_products': product.category.product_set.exclude(id=product.id)[:4]
    }
    
    return render(request, 'store/product-detail.html', context)
```

### HTML/CSS
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow BEM methodology for CSS classes
- Keep CSS organized and commented
- Use Bootstrap classes when appropriate
- Ensure responsive design

### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ features
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Handle errors gracefully

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run specific app tests
python manage.py test store

# Run with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
coverage html  # Generate HTML report
```

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for all new features
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Example Test
```python
from django.test import TestCase, Client
from django.urls import reverse
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from store.models import Product, Category


class ProductViewsTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test data."""
        self.client = Client()
        self.user = User.objects.create_user(
            username='testuser',
            password='testpass123'
        )
        self.category = Category.objects.create(name='Electronics')
        self.product = Product.objects.create(
            name='Test Product',
            category=self.category,
            price=99.99
        )

    def test_product_list_view(self):
        """Test that product list view returns correct response."""
        response = self.client.get(reverse('product_list'))
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertContains(response, 'Test Product')

    def test_product_detail_view(self):
        """Test that product detail view returns correct product."""
        response = self.client.get(
            reverse('product_detail', args=[self.product.id])
        )
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertContains(response, self.product.name)
```
